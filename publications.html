            <p>We will first develop Einstein field equation with cosmological constant using Riemannian geometry.
Now I considered that cosmological constant is associated with the vacuum energy density of particle physics model. Using
Euclidean quantum gravity of path integral formalism and use of Robertson Walker metric(RW) I calculate the contribution
of matter density to the fluctuating metric. This method rather leads to the observed cosmological constant without any
need of fine tuning in the gravity and the particle physics model. this straightforward approach is very much useful and it is
justified for all points of view.</p>

            <p>Water is a critical renewable resource that is not evenly distributed around the world,and over-exploitation has altered the water cycle, not allowing to be restored. Since several previous decades, the need for drinking water per year has been increased at a
staggering rate. This need has been palliated through desalination processes to obtain potable water from seawater and brackish water, desalination has been based on thermal methods like MED and MSF and the use of membrane processes like the reverse osmosis. These methods
require the use of energy that has been provided mostly by fossil plants..</p>

            <p>Ecology means the study of environment. In 1869 Ernst Haeckel defined ecology as –
“Relation of animal to its organic as well as inorganic environment”. Each and every living
beings on earth (e.g. plants, animals, microorganisms, even the viruses) are connected
directly or indirectly with each other with an invisible thread. These living organisms
also are depending on the abiotic components (e.g. soil, water, air) in our environment.
The relation between the biotic or living and the abiotic or non-living components on
earth is called the ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Our solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago from a huge nebular cloud of dust and gas but the scientific
evidence of its formation were on the randomness of other solar system forming in different nebular cloud
or in other galaxies as seen today. At first the huge cloud of dust collapsed in its own gravity under the
influence of nearby stellar pressure, contraction, swirling and huge temperature at the center created our
sun, surrounding smaller balls of different material contracted and condensated forming eight planets,
hundreds of moons, millions of asteroids and comets, this took almost billion years to form a complete and
clean solar system.</p>

            <h5>GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BIOLOGICAL WARFARE: A NEW GENERATION OF WEAPONS FOR MODERN WARFARE AND TECHNOLOGY - SOMNATH DAS</h5>
            <p>Biological weapons are designed to spread disease among people, plants, and animals through
the introduction of toxins and microorganisms such as viruses and bacteria. The method
through which a biological weapon is deployed depends on the agent itself, its preparation,
its durability, and the route of infection. Attackers may disperse these agents through aerosols
or food and water supplies. Although bioweapons have been used in war for many centuries,
a recent surge in genetic understanding, as well as a rapid growth in computational power,
hasallowed genetic engineering to play a larger role in the development of new bioweapons. In the
bioweapon industry, genetic engineering can be used to manipulate genes to create new pathogenic
characteristics aimed at enhancing the efficacy of the weapon through increased survivability,infectivity, virulence, and drug resistance. While the positive societal implications of improved
biotechnology are apparent, the “black biology” of bioweapon development may be “one of the
gravest threats we will face”.</p>

            <p>Brain computer interface is a fast growing emergent technology in which researchers aim
to build a direct channel between human brain and the computer. An interface is a shared
boundary in which information is shared across two or more separate components of a
computer. BCI which is also called neural-control interface is a direct communication pathway
between a wired brain and an external device. Information flow is bidirectional in it. This
technique is beneficial in the useful functioning of people disabled by certain neuromuscular
disorders such as cerebral palsy, stroke or spinal cord injury. Wheel chair control is the best
example this technique. This measures the signal produce by central nervous system.</p>

            <h5>The Structure of UFO-Souvik Das & Arya Mukherjee</h5>
            <p>UFOs or Unidentified Flying Objects have racked the brains of thinkers and conspiracy
theorists for ages since prehistoric times and will do so, for ages to come. When we
decipher the mysteries for the existing crisis, another will come up. People have claimed
sightings of mysterious flying machines supposedly more advanced than the ones we have. People
have been claiming this for a long time, and this is not a recent upsurge of action. True that
mankind has always had the ability to fantasize but as the saying goes, ‘all lies have a core of
truth’. In this paper we shall endeavour to construct the structure of an UFO based on popular
thoughts and then try to solve the working of it from the perspectives of an Engineer. We shall
see how UFOs look and then try to work out a simple mechanism so as to mimic it’s working.
Expected outcome of the project This Project shows the possibility of such a flying object as has
been thought about and this shall end a debate to the possibility of existence of such an unknown
object. It is quite probable that such objects do exist. Now, there are two theories about the UFOs.
One states they belong to intelligent lifeforms from outside the planet. Other theory suggests that
UFOs are but government secrets. This paper doesn’t aim at fanning the doubt towards either of
the roads but merely suggest that the thing exists,whoever owns them..</p>

            <p>First of all What is time? Most of people think of time as a constant, but physicist Albert
Einstein showed that time is an illusion; it is relative — it can vary for different observers
depending on your speed through space. For Einstein it is the “fourth dimension” where
Space is considered as a three- dimensional arena, with coordinates — such as length, width and
height showing location. Time provides another coordinate , direction , although conventionally, it
only moves forward. Einstein’s theory of special relativity says that time slows down or speeds
up depending on how fast you move relative to something else.</p>

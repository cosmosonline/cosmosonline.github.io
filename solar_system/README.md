# Solar.css
## Pure CSS Solar System Animation

### Exploration
- Solar system: The planets, objects and orbits around the Sun are illustrated by pure CSS at scale for their relative sizes.
- Distances to the Sun are mathematically scaled and positioned for ideal view.
- Animation durations are timely scaled relative to the Earth year by true sidereal periods. One Earth year in the animation is 10 seconds.
- The Asteroid belt is generated with pure CSS.
- Solar System in 3D Mode.
- Some fun micro-animations.
